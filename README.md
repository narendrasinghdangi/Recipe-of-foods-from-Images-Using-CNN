# Recipe-of-foods-from-Images-Using-CNN
Abstractâ€” The process of Determining food nutrition from an image is quite an interesting field with various applications. Since food monitoring plays a crucial role in health-related problems, it is becoming more essential in our day-to-day lives. In this paper, an approach has been presented to classify images of food using convolutional neural networks. Unlike the traditional artificial neural networks, convolutional neural networks have the capability of estimating the score function directly from image pixels. The dataset used is Food-Nut and the programming language used is Python3. A 2D convolution layer has been utilised which creates a convolution kernel that is convolved with the layer input to produce a tensor of outputs. There are multiple such layers, and the outputs are concatenated at parts to form the final tensor of outputs. We also use the Max-Pooling function for the data, and the features extracted from this function are used to train the network. An accuracy of 90.47% for the classes of the dataset is recognised using the proposed implementation.
